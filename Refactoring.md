# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

I extracted the logic for computing the partition key into a separate getPartitionKey function. This makes the code easier to read by separating concerns and improving the readability of the main function.
I split the original if statement into several functions to improve the readability of the code. The stringifyCandidate function converts the candidate value to a string, while the truncateCandidate function truncates the candidate string if it exceeds MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH and generates a hash. By splitting the original code into separate functions, the main function deterministicPartitionKey becomes more readable and easier to understand.
I used constants instead of hardcoding values in the function. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to change if the values of the constants need to be updated in the future.
Explanation of choices
I made these changes to improve the readability and maintainability of the code. By separating the logic for computing the partition key into a separate function, the main function becomes easier to read and understand. The use of constants makes the code easier to maintain and update if necessary. Finally, by splitting the code into separate functions, the code is easier to read and understand as each function is responsible for a specific task. This also makes the code more modular and easier to test.
